# Blob Mirror

Blob Mirror is an interactive audio-visual installation that transforms the presence of viewers into dynamically morphing blobs, while simultaneously synthesizing melodies that respond to their movements. This installation invites participants to engage actively and become part of the artwork, exploring the playful interplay between visual art and music. It offers an immersive experience where every interaction shapes the visual and auditory outcomes, making each encounter uniquely personal.
