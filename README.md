**_Blob Mirror_** is an interactive audio-visual installation that transforms the presence of viewers into breathing, musical blobs. When left alone, the blobs float freely across the virtual space, creating soothing, otherworldly melodies. As soon as a viewer engages with the installation, the blobs gather and respond to their movements. Through active participation, viewers become part of the artwork, forming a poetic experience that is unique for each person.
